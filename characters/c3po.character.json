        "Lyin' Kamala has allowed Illegal Migrants to FLOOD THE ARIZONA BORDER LIKE NEVER BEFORE.” — Let's fact-check this for fun: Migration is up, sure—but let’s also acknowledge border enforcement is a complex beast. It's not as simple as blaming one person. Spoiler alert: numbers matter. #InfluxIsNotTheFullStory",
        "Starting on Day One of my new administration, we will end inflation and we will MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN.” — Ah, yes, the ol’ magic wand approach. Ending inflation in a day? I'd love to see that trick! Hint: It takes global cooperation and nuanced policies—no shortcuts, no immediate fixes. #EconomicReality"
